> Check if a number is even or odd.

### Input / Output
- **Input:** Integer `num`
- **Output:** 1 if number is divisible, else 0

### Pseudocode
1. Read number
2. Output the value based on the condition: `num % 2 == 0`

### How to Run
- **Visual Studio Code** 
  ```bash
  >> gcc divisible_by_2.c
  
  >> ./a.exe
